    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Linear Data Structures__ are collections of elements arranged in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its predecessor and successor. We'll concentrate on four primary linear data structures: arrays, queues, stacks, and linked lists.\n",
    "* __Arrays__ are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type, allowing for efficient indexing and iteration. They are commonly used for storing homogeneous data and provide fast access to elements via their indices.\n",
    "* __Queues, stacks, and linked lists__ are linear data structures that have different access patterns and use cases. Queues follow a first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, stacks follow a last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle, and linked lists consist of nodes that point to each other, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.\n",

    "## Linear versus Non-Linear Data Structures\n",
    "A data structure is an abstract model for organizing and storing data in memory so that specific operations—such as insertion, deletion, lookup, and traversal—can be performed efficiently. Different data structures offer trade-offs in time complexity and space usage. Choosing the right data structure is essential for optimizing algorithm performance and resource consumption.\n",

    "> Let's consider two linear and non-linear data structures and how they differ in terms of organization and access patterns.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Linear Data Structures__ store elements in a sequential, contiguous manner, where each element has a single predecessor and successor (excluding the ends of the data). Navigating and indexing are straightforward for a linear data structure, as elements are stored in a single, linear sequence. Examples that we'll explore here include __arrays__, __stacks__, __queues__ and __linked lists__.\n",
    "> * __Non-Linear Data Structures__ store elements in a hierarchical or interconnected manner, where each element can have multiple predecessors and successors. This allows for more complex relationships between elements, but also makes navigation and indexing more complicated. Examples that we'll consider later include trees and graphs.\n",

    "## Arrays\n",
    "An array is a fixed-size, _homogeneous_ collection of elements—each element is the same type—stored in a contiguous memory block. The contiguous memory layout provides _constant-time access_ to the values stored in the array using an index. Consider the 1-dimensional array $\\mathbf{a}$, which contains $n = 6$ elements of type `T::Int`:\n",

    "The name of an array, e.g., $\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, points to the first element, then each subsequent element in the array is located at an address that is `sizeof(T)` bytes from the memory address of the previous element. We access the elements of the array $\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ using their index. Different languages have different indexing conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-dimensional arrays\n",
    "The array $\\mathbf{a}$ is 1-dimensional, like a row or column. Arrays can be multi-dimensional: two-dimensional arrays (matrices) organize data into rows and columns for tables or images, while higher-order arrays (tensors) extend to three or more axes for color channels, time-series, machine learning feature maps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses of 1- and Higher-Dimensional Arrays\n",
    "* __Structured Datasets as 2D Arrays:__ Tabular data are loaded into a 2D array with rows as observations and columns as features, facilitating slicing into training/test sets, scaling features, and input to machine learning libraries.\n",
    "* __Vectorized Computation and Transformation:__ Arrays enable elementwise arithmetic and linear algebra operations—like dot products and broadcasting—without explicit loops, potentially speeding up some everyday computational tasks.\n",
    "* __Multidimensional Input Encoding:__ Images (height × width × channels), time-series windows, and word embeddings are naturally stored in 2D or 3D arrays, plugging seamlessly into various machine learning and artificial intelligence models. \n",

    "A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is a linear data structure that follows the __Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)__ principle. Elements are added and removed from the __top of the stack__. Stacks provide constant-time operations for adding and removing elements. Consider the stack `s::Stack{Int64}`:\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Common uses for Stacks__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __Function call stack__: The function call stack is a runtime structure that uses a LIFO stack to manage active functions. Each time a function is invoked, a new stack frame—containing its parameters, local variables, and return address—is pushed onto the call stack. When the function finishes, its frame is popped, restoring the previous execution context.\n",
    "> * __Expression evaluation and syntax parsing__: Stack data structures can also be used to evaluate mathematical expressions, such as those in postfix notation. Operands are pushed onto the stack in this case, and operators are applied to the most recently pushed operands. The result is then pushed back onto the stack until the entire expression has been evaluated.\n",
    "> * __Undo/redo mechanisms__: Many applications that let users undo and redo actions use a stack data structure to track these activities. When a user performs an action, such as typing a letter or moving an object, it is pushed onto the stack. To undo an action, the most recent activity is removed from the stack, while the redo feature re-adds the undone actions.\n",

    "A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is a linear data structure that operates on the __First-In-First-Out (FIFO)__ principle. The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues implement efficient operations for adding elements to the rear of the queue and removing elements from the front, making it ideal for scenarios like task scheduling.

Each task is placed in a queue, and the operating system schedules tasks in the order they were added to the queue, allowing tasks to be processed in the order they were received.\n",
    "> * __Breadth-first search__: In graph theory, the breadth-first search algorithm explores a graph by visiting all the vertices at a given level before moving on to the next level. This can be implemented using a queue data structure, where the vertices at each level are added to the queue in order and processed in that exact order.\n",
    "> * __Message passing__: Queues are often used to pass messages between different parts of a system, such as between a producer and a consumer in a messaging system. The producer adds messages to the bottom of the queue, and the consumer consumes them from the top of the queue. This allows the producer and consumer to operate at different speeds without the risk of messages being lost or overwritten.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Common uses of Linked Lists__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Dynamic data structures__: Linked lists are helpful when working with data structures that can change in size during runtime. Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink as needed without complex memory management or copying operations. This makes them helpful in implementing stacks, queues, and other dynamic data structures.\n",
    "> * __Memory allocation__: In computer memory management, linked lists are used to keep track of free and allocated memory blocks. Each memory block is represented as a node in the list, with a pointer to the next block. This allows the system to find a suitable block for a new allocation quickly and to free up blocks when they are no longer needed efficiently.\n",
    "> * __Modeling hierarchical data__: Linked lists can represent hierarchical data structures, such as trees and graphs. Each node in the list represents a tree node or graph vertex and contains a pointer to its children or neighbors. This allows the data to be stored and manipulated efficiently while maintaining the hierarchical structure.\n",
